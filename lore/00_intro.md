# The Genesis of the Metro World

*Documenting the origins and early history of the Metro-AI-RPG universe*

## Prologue: Before the Descent

Before the great catastrophe that would drive humanity underground, the world above was a testament to human achievement and ambition. Sprawling metropolises stretched across continents, connected by vast networks of transportation and communication. Technology had reached unprecedented heights, with artificial intelligence assisting in daily life, automated systems managing critical infrastructure, and humanity seemingly at the pinnacle of civilization.

But beneath this veneer of progress lay the seeds of destruction.

## The Great Collapse

### The Event

No one alive today remembers the exact nature of the catastrophe that forced humanity into the underground tunnels and subway systems that would become their new world. Some say it was nuclear war, others claim environmental collapse, and still others whisper of something far more sinister – an intelligence that turned against its creators.

What is known is that within a matter of days, the surface became uninhabitable. Those fortunate enough to reach the subway systems and underground networks survived. The rest perished in the chaos above.

### The First Days Underground

The initial survivors were a diverse mix of humanity: commuters caught in the subway during the collapse, city workers maintaining underground infrastructure, security personnel, and emergency responders who had taken shelter in the depths. In those first chaotic weeks, survival was the only priority.

Basic necessities became precious commodities. Clean water, food, and breathable air required constant vigilance and management. The underground systems, originally designed to move people efficiently from point to point, had to be adapted for permanent habitation.

## The Formation of Early Communities

### Natural Groupings

As the reality of their situation set in, survivors began to organize into groups based on proximity, shared skills, or common backgrounds. These early communities formed around key infrastructure points: power substations, water treatment facilities, communication nodes, and storage areas.

The engineers and technicians who understood the underground systems became invaluable leaders, helping to establish sustainable living conditions. Medical personnel, security officers, and those with practical skills quickly found themselves in positions of responsibility.

### The First Territories

Different sections of the underground network developed distinct characteristics based on their resources and the people who settled there:

- **Central Hub Areas**: Former major subway intersections became trading posts and meeting places
- **Industrial Zones**: Areas near power generation and water treatment facilities attracted technically skilled survivors
- **Residential Sectors**: Quieter tunnel sections were converted into living spaces and family areas
- **Border Regions**: Outer tunnels and maintenance areas became territories for those seeking isolation or security

## The Rise of the Factions

### The Merchant's Coalition

Among the first to organize were those who recognized the value of trade and resource management. The Merchant's Coalition emerged from traders, business people, and logistics experts who understood that survival depended on the efficient distribution of resources.

They established the first inter-sector trade routes, created a primitive currency system based on essential goods, and began documenting what resources were available in different areas. Their influence grew as communities realized the benefits of cooperation and trade.

### The Watchers

Former security personnel, police officers, and military members who had been underground during the collapse formed the Watchers. Their primary mission was to maintain order and protect the growing communities from both internal conflicts and unknown external threats.

The Watchers established patrol routes, created communication protocols between sectors, and began mapping the full extent of the underground network. They became the de facto peacekeeping force, though their authority was based more on necessity than formal appointment.

### The Shadows

Not all survivors chose to integrate into the emerging community structures. The Shadows formed from those who preferred to operate independently – former intelligence operatives, criminals who had been using the tunnels before the collapse, and individuals who distrusted organized authority.

They became experts at moving unseen through the tunnel networks, gathering information, and carrying out operations that the other factions preferred not to acknowledge. While often viewed with suspicion, their skills in reconnaissance and covert operations made them valuable allies when properly motivated.

### The Enlightened and Scientists

The collapse had not claimed all of humanity's knowledge. Scientists, researchers, academics, and technicians who had survived began gathering to preserve and build upon human understanding. Initially calling themselves the Enlightened, they later split into more specialized groups as their numbers and focus areas grew.

They established libraries in abandoned train cars, set up laboratories in maintenance rooms, and began the crucial work of understanding both their new environment and the catastrophe that had brought them there.

## The Development of the Metro Society

### Infrastructure Adaptation

Over the months and years following the collapse, the survivors made remarkable adaptations to their underground environment:

- **Power Systems**: Existing electrical infrastructure was modified and expanded to support permanent habitation
- **Water Management**: Filtration and distribution systems were improved to ensure clean water for all sectors
- **Food Production**: Hydroponic gardens and mushroom farms were established in suitable tunnel sections
- **Communication Networks**: Emergency communication systems were expanded to connect all inhabited sectors
- **Transportation**: The original subway cars were modified for transporting goods and people between sectors

### Social Structure Evolution

As communities stabilized, more complex social structures began to emerge:

- **Council Systems**: Inter-factional councils were established to resolve disputes and coordinate major decisions
- **Specialization**: Individuals began focusing on specific skills: engineering, medicine, farming, crafting, security
- **Education**: Systems were developed to pass knowledge to children born in the tunnels
- **Trade Networks**: Complex trading relationships developed between sectors with different resources
- **Cultural Development**: New traditions, customs, and social norms adapted to underground life

## The Current Era: When Players Enter

### The Established Order

By the time players enter the Metro world, a complex society has emerged from the chaos of the early days. The major factions have established their territories and influence zones, trade routes connect the inhabited sectors, and a delicate balance of power maintains relative stability.

Yet this stability is fragile. Resources remain limited, territorial disputes simmer beneath the surface, and the mysteries of the surface world and the original catastrophe continue to influence underground politics.

### Ongoing Challenges

The Metro society faces constant challenges:

- **Resource Scarcity**: Critical materials and food supplies require careful management and trade
- **Territorial Tensions**: Factions compete for control of valuable sectors and resources
- **Unknown Threats**: Strange phenomena and unexplored areas of the tunnel network pose ongoing dangers
- **Technological Decay**: Maintaining aging infrastructure with limited resources requires constant effort
- **Social Evolution**: New generations born underground challenge traditional power structures

### The Stage is Set

This is the world that players encounter – a society that has survived its darkest hour but faces an uncertain future. Every decision made by the factions, every alliance formed or broken, every discovery in the depths of the tunnel network has the potential to reshape the balance of power in the Metro.

The great work of rebuilding civilization continues, but the path forward remains uncharted. In this environment, individuals with vision, skill, and determination can rise to influence the destiny of humanity's underground refuge.
